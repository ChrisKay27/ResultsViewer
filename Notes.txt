Experiment number is necessary because the results can be skewed by experiments that vary over different variables.

Example:
You run an experiment with the parameters:

SEED:1
Topology:HyperCube
NumPages:100
ArrivalRate:100,200,300
DDP:AgentDeadlockDetectionProtocol,TimeoutDeadlockDetection,ChandyMisraHaasDDP
DRP:FirstDeadlockResolution
PP:EarliestDeadlineFirst
DetectionInterval:200
MaxActiveTransactions:10
AgentsHistoryLength:3
UpdateRate:.5

And now you want to see the results of it, but you ran another experiment with NumPages:100000.
You don't want to see those results combined with this experiment do you?
